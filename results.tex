The computed volumes of the prostates from the MR and ARFI imaging data are
presented in Table~\ref{tab:fig_mr_arfi_volumes}.  The subvolumes associated
with the zonal anatomy in each imaging modality was measured
(Figure~\ref{fig:fig_mr_arfi_volumes}(a)), showing an mean overestimation of
total prostate volume of 36.7 $\pm$ 27.9\% by ARFI imaging compared to MR
volumes (Figure~\ref{fig:fig_mr_arfi_volumes}(b)), and a relative
underestimation of the central zone volume relative to the central gland in MR
imaging of -15.3 $\pm$ 13.0 \% (Figure~\ref{fig:fig_mr_arfi_volumes}(c)).

Weights and axis measurements from the gross pathology processing of the
excised prostates were collected (Table~\ref{tab:path_data}), and using the
axis measurements (lateral-to-lateral, anterior-to-posterior, and
apex-to-base), the prostate volume was approximated as a tri-axial ellipsoid,
and its volume was estimated.

MR and ARFI imaging total prostate volumes were also compared with the weights
and prostate volumes, approximated to be tri-axial ellipsoids, and calculated
from measurements of the prostate semi-principal axes.  Prostate weights were
moderately correlated with estimated pathology ellipsoidal prostate volumes
(Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_weight}(a), R$^2$ = 0.68).  There was moderate
correlation between the prostate weight and the image-reconstructed prostate
volumes (Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_weight}(b), R$^2$ = 0.44 (MR) and 0.21
(ARFI)), though there was weaker correlation with the ellipsoidal approximation
of the measurement prostate volume and the image-recontructed volumens
(Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_weight}(c), R$^2$ = 0.08 (MR) and 0.01 (ARFI)).

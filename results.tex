The computed volumes of the prostates from the MR and ARFI imaging data are
presented in Table~\ref{tab:mr_arfi_volumes}.  The subvolumes associated
with the zonal anatomy in each imaging modality was measured
(Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_volumes}(a)), showing an mean overestimation of
total prostate volume of 36.7 $\pm$ 27.9\% by ARFI imaging compared to MR
volumes (Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_volumes}(b)), and a relative
underestimation of the central zone volume relative to the central gland in MR
imaging of -15.3 $\pm$ 13.0 \% (Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_volumes}(c)).

Weights and axis measurements from the gross pathology processing of the
excised prostates were collected (Table~\ref{tab:path_data}), and using the
axis measurements (lateral-to-lateral, anterior-to-posterior, and
apex-to-base), the prostate volume was approximated as a tri-axial ellipsoid,
and its volume was estimated.

MR and ARFI imaging total prostate volumes were also compared with the weights
and prostate volumes, approximated to be tri-axial ellipsoids, and calculated
from measurements of the prostate semi-principal axes.  Prostate weights were
moderately correlated with estimated pathology ellipsoidal prostate volumes
(Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_weight}(a), R$^2$ = 0.68).  There was moderate
correlation between the prostate weight and the image-reconstructed prostate
volumes (Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_weight}(b), R$^2$ = 0.44 (MR) and 0.21
(ARFI)), though there was weaker correlation with the ellipsoidal approximation
of the measurement prostate volume and the image-recontructed volumens
(Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_weight}(c), R$^2$ = 0.08 (MR) and 0.01 (ARFI)).

While difficult to compare the absolute lengths of the major and minor
anatomical axes of the prostates between the imaging modalities and pathology
due to different geometric distortions during imaging and changes to the organ
after excision, measurements of the prostate dimensions along the three
standard anatomic axes (apex-to-base, lateral-to-lateral, and
anterior-to-posterior) were made (Table~\ref{tab:mr_arfi_axes}), and the
relative ratios of the axes in imaging and pathology for the total prostate
volume were compared (Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_total_axes}), and the relative
ratios of the central gland / zone anatomy were compared for MR and ARFI
imaging (Figure~\ref{fig:mr_arfi_central_axes}).  The mean ratio differences between ARFI imaging, T2WI MR and pathology are compiled in Table~\ref{tab:axis_ratio_over_under}.

\textbf{Similar work has been done with other ultrasonic imaging modalities that strive
to characterize the viscoelastic properties of the prostate in comparison to MR
imaging, as has been done by Mahdavi \etal~\cite{Mahdavi2011}, where
vibro-elastography has been developed to visualize and segment the prostate in
synergy with B-mode ultrasound, with MRI used as the imaging gold standard.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sect:intro}

Kirema's intro text will go here.

Section~\ref{sect:background} provides an overview of MR and ARFI imaging in
the prostate and an overall clinical motivation for prostate imaging.
Section~\ref{sect:methods} describes the methods used to experimentally-acquire
our imaging data, process of gross pathological specimens post radical
prostatectomy, and image process our datasets.  The results of our analysis,
including gross pathology and imaging prostate axis and volume estimates, are
presented in Section~\ref{sect:results}, along with a statistical analysis of
the bias and variability associated with each imaging modalities measurements,
all of which is discussed in Section~\ref{sect:discussion}.

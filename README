Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Prostate Zonal Anatomy: Comparison with
Endorectal T2-Weighted MR Imaging (T2WI)

This manuscript utilizes the IEEEtran.cls for LaTeX that is assumed to be
available for compilation.

compile-n-view.sh can be run to get realtime LaTeX rendering, if you have latexmk installed; otherwise, pdflatex can be used (cannot use latex directly since jpb/png images are being included directly).  I have specifically *not* included mr_arfi_anatomy.pdf in the committed repository since that can create lots of conflicts w/ intermediate editing & viewing of the manuscript, so you need to compile it in your local working version

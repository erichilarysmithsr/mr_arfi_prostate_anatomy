Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Imaging Prostate Zonal Anatomy:
Comparison with 3T T2-Weighted MR Imaging (T2WI)

This manuscript utilizes the IEEEtran.cls for LaTeX that is assumed to be
available for compilation.  Lots of other LaTeX packages are imported in
mr_arfi_anatomy.tex .

compile-n-view.sh can be run to get realtime LaTeX rendering, if you have
latexmk installed; otherwise, pdflatex can be used (cannot use latex directly
since jpb/png images are being included directly).  I have specifically *not*
included mr_arfi_anatomy.pdf in the committed repository since that can create
lots of conflicts w/ intermediate editing & viewing of the manuscript, so you
need to compile it in your local working version

parse.py will parse the document into the individual files that need to be
uploaded; though all of the PDFs need to be converted to PS files.  Figure
files were also cropped before converting to PS.

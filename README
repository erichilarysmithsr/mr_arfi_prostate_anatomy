Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Prostate Zonal Anatomy: Comparison with
Endorectal T2-Weighted MR Imaging (T2WI)

This manuscript utilizes the IEEEtran.cls for LaTeX that is assumed to be
available for compilation.

compile-n-view.sh can be run to get realtime LaTeX rendering, if you have latexmk installed; otherwise, pdflatex can be used (cannot use latex directly since jpb/png images are being included directly)

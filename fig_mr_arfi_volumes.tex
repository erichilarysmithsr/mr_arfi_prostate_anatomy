\caption{Comparison of MR and ARFI zonal anatomy volume estimates from
    manually-segmented images.  Total prostate gland volumes ranged from
    19.6--71.0 cm$^3$ based on MR image models (a), with a moderate correlation
    between MR and ARFI imaging for both the total gland volume (R$^2$ = 0.63,
    (b)) and the central gland (R$^2$ = 0.38, (c)).  The ARFI total gland
    volumes had a positive bias compared with the MR volumes (6.1 $\pm$ 25.0\%
    (b)), while the ARFI central zone volumes were on average more similar
    (-5.0 $\pm$ 39.5\%, (c)), but with some significant variability between
    study subjects.  Table~\ref{tab:mr_arfi_volumes} contains the individual
    volume estimates for the total prostate and central glands.}

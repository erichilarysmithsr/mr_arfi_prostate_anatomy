\textbf{Since both B-mode and ARFI imaging data were acquired concurrently using the same probe and sequences, the datasets are perfectly spatially co-registered and could be loaded concurrently into 3D Slicer in the same voxel space, achieving perfect spatial registration of segmentations utilizing both B-mode and ARFI image features.}

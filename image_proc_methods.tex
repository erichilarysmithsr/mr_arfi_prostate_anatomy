\subsection{Image Zonal Anatomy Segmentation and 3D Model Rendering}
Axial T2W MR slices were manually segmented using the polygon tool on
ITK-SNAP~\cite{Yushkevich2006} using separate labels for the peripheral zone
(PZ), central gland (CG) and anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFS). The gland was
segmented from base to apex.  The base was identified below the bladder and
subsequent images were segmented until the last slice with visible prostatic
tissue was identified caudally. The CG, PZ and AFS were segmented independently
according to their well-established anatomical characteristics on
T2WI.~\cite{Verma2011,Jung2012,Poon1985,Hricak2007,Bonekamp2011} The PZ was
identified by its homogenous high signal intensity on T2WI, which is usually
similar to that of the nearby periprostatic fat. The CG was visualized and
delineated based on its heterogeneous and lower signal intensity as well as its
location. Although not readily visible on every case, the AFS was identified by
its low T2 signal intensity and its location anterior to the central gland. 

ARFI images were segmented using a similar procedure to the MR images, using
XXXX (INSERT CRITERIA HERE).  

Segmented image stacks were imported into 3D Slicer (v4.3.0, CITATION) and 3D
models were rendered using the following parameters (Table~\ref{tab:3dslicer}:
